# Convergence Battle

Taking cues from the iOS game Nightgate, this JS implementation of a convergence battle system are built
off:

* matter.js
* hammer.js
* pressure.js
* vue.js
* firebase.js

Join an arena of combatants, and shoot your way to victory. This battle system should allow web users to log in
and join an arena with other competitors, each connected in real time via websockets (or should it be peer to peer?).

Steering is inspired by Nightgate. Tap your finger on the right side of the screen and spin your finger to steer.
Thrust is pressure sensitive. (Because of this, this JS game can only be played on iPhones and iPads. (And iPods?)
